\section{Goal}
We intend to implement a library for Fourier Series related computation. We mainly implement the following functions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Compute the Fourier series of a given function.
	\item Compute the value of a function with given variable value and the Fourier Series of a function.
	\item Implement the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of Fourier Series.
	\item Implement some basic functions (sin, exp, etc.) of Fourier Series.
	\item Input and output of Fourier Series. 
\end{itemize}

The aforementioned function shall be a function $\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, whose Fourier Series exists.

\section{Motivation}
An equation solver, whose development I currently participate in, utilizes Taylor Series, and I intend to see if the Taylor Series in it can be replaced by Fourier Series. For this purpose, I need to implement a basic library for the Fourier Series related computations, hence this library.

\section{Environment}
This library is developed and tested on a fully updated 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04, and might be tested on the macOS 10.14 and 10.15 (after its release). 

This library's compatibility with other environments are not guaranteed nor tested, although I guess that it should be compatible with 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04.
